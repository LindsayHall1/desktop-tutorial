# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.
Lindsay Hall
My name is Lindsay Hall, and this repository was created to learn the basics of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop.
Git helps track changes and recover past versions of files, GitHub stores and shares projects online, and GitHub Desktop makes version control easier with a user-friendly interface.
Together, these tools make managing and organizing projects easier.
